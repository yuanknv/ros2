# About
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.
From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project.
And it's all open source.
Full project details on [ROS.org](https://ros.org/)

# Building
First, install git if not installed already:
```
sudo apt install -y git
```

Then, install pixi:

```
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

Now, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/karsten-nvidia/ros2.git && cd ros2
```

Now `pixi` can be used to perform the most important steps. To build a package like rclcpp, use

```
pixi run build rclcpp
```

Note that the above command will automatically install the environment and clone all required source code, so it will take a while.

To run tests, use

```
pixi run test rclcpp
```

To see all available commands, use

```
pixi task list
```

# Getting Started
Looking to get started with ROS?
Our [installation guide is here](https://www.ros.org/blog/getting-started/).
Once you've installed ROS start by learning some [basic concepts](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/Basic.html) and take a look at our [beginner tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html).
